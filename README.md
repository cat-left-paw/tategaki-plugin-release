## What it can do

- Vertical writing editor (WYSIWYG-style layout)
- New “Writing & Reference” mode: edits Obsidian Markdown directly (no conversion / no sync step)
- Ruby (furigana) support (Aozora Bunko style), e.g. `｜漢字《かんじ》`
- Images (standard Markdown images and Obsidian embeds)
- Outline navigation and heading folding
- Book mode for reading (paging)
- Compatibility mode (TipTap-based editor) for older workflows
- Theme settings (font, spacing, etc.)
